    "\n",
    "1. Re-ask your question\n",
    "2. Perform EDA\n",
    "3. Start with a dummy clasifier -> assigns everything to the majority class:\n",

    "    - Area under curve, AOC & ROC\n",
    "        - Start with this first to see what model is best\n",
    "        - ROC & AOC take into account all the CM at different thresholds and is good if you're trying to compare models\n",
    "    - Accuracy \n",
